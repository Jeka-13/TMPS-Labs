Second lab for TMPS

## Topic: Company producing cars

## Introduction

Let's suppose we have a person who wants to buy a car. The person goes to the BMW office and chooses the type of the car wants and the method for the delivering it.

## Patterns used
- **Decorator** *For generating notifications*
- **Proxy** *For creating cache system*

## Implementation/Explanation

As I've said I've used **Decorator**, **Proxy**  
**Decorator** I have used for generating notifications. I have created Interface with method notify
and depending on the way chosen by the client - it will send notification to specific social network.  
**Proxy** Simulates the cache system, let's suppose we have a server and in order not to connect everytime
to the server, we will have a cache system. 

## Results
During this Lab I have learned patterns and made a project which combines some of them
